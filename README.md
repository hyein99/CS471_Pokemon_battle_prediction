# CS471_Pokemon_battle_prediction
## Project Overview
This project is a team effort resulting from the CS471 Graph Machine Learning and Mining course. Our objective was to develop a program that predicts the outcome of Pokemon battles using link prediction techniques.

### Contribution
We utilized link prediction methods to analyze and forecast the results of Pokemon battles. This approach involves using graph-based machine learning to model the relationships and interactions between different Pokemon, thereby enabling us to predict the likely winner in a given battle scenario.

### Features
* Predicts the winner of a Pokemon battle based on historical data
* Utilizes advanced graph machine learning techniques for prediction
* Provides insights into the factors influencing battle outcomes

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pokemon - Weedle's Cave dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terminus7/pokemon-challenge). This dataset provides comprehensive information about various Pokemon, their statistics, and battle outcomes, which were essential for training and evaluating our prediction model.

## Installation
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/hyein99/CS471_Pokemon_battle_prediction.git

cd pokemon-battle-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the prediction model with the following command:
```
